TIA!

This is Africa!

Three of the most cringeworthy letters you’ll hear travelling through Africa.

I cringe because it’s condescending.

Rather than retype out what another has written well, let me quote Jacqueline Muna Musiitwa:

*“(TIA) is used in the context of what is perceived to be “African” versus “unAfrican”. … unAfrican includes, but is not limited to, systems that work, clean places and timeliness. African, however, is dirty, tardy and disorganised. Even though I surround myself with Afro-optimists, I have never heard TIA used in a positive context. As such, it perpetuates negative stereotypes of Africa.*

The full article: [TIA – This is Africa](http://www.thoughtleader.co.za/archbishoptutufellows/2011/09/27/tia-this-is-africa/), is not very long and worth it.
