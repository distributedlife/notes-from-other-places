In Romania, and in other Eastern European countries, the weight of the food you are ordering is listed next to the price. In Cluj-Napoca we had gone to a pasta place that a local American man had said was his favourite.

"I feel the portion sizes at the other places are too small."

That should have been a hint.

Jess had a choice between 400g and 690g of pasta. Unfamiliar with knowing how much she could eat she chose the 690g edition. I ordered gnocchi that was only served in the 690g size. 

I ended up eating about 1kg of pasta that night. It turns out that 400g was probably about right for her.

So much pasta.
