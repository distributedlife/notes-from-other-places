I found myself outside Los Angeles airport. A strange man asked me if I wanted to buy a CD of *The Rolling Stones* latest album. I wasn't immediately interested so he tried to assure me: it's still in its plastic wrapper. 

It was.

I let him know that I didn't have anything to play it. He seemed to remember that iPods existed and wandered off.
