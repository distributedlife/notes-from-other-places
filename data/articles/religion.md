We board our luxurious bus in the late afternoon. We're heading to the town of Iksan in South Korea. Our friends are living there at the moment and we're coming to visit. The sprawling that is Incheon-Seoul gives away to green fields laced with roads. We pass through small intense pockets of Korean cities. These give way to the green again and the sun sets.

Around us is black and we continue to whizz past small towns. I start to notice something strange, something we didn't expect in Asia. Around us in all directions are ominous glowing read beacons across the land.

Take a night bus is Korea and you'll see something you went expect in Asia. Elevated, illuminated red crosses glowing like ominous beacons across the land.

There are so many

The kind of non-obvious fervor I saw in Africa.
