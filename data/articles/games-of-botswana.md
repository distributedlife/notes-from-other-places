There is a game they play in Botswana. It involves drawing two lines on the ground a few metres away from each other. You stand behind one line, pick up a piece of impala dung, pop it in your mouth and see how far you can spit it.

If you don’t make the first like, you’re disqualified.

The furthest spitter wins. The locals were much better than our group. Jess and I opted out.
