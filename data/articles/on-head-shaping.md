In Nicosia we went through the Cyprus museum to witness their collection of pottery fragments and ended up learning a little bit about head shaping. Head shaping is a practice that went on at one point in Cyprus’ history. 

When a human is born their skull is pliant. By binding the skull one could give it an identifiable shape. It is suggested by the exhibit that head shaping was done to indicate class. It’s hard to move out of one’s class when it involves changing the shape of your skull.

Why the long face?

Probably due to the flagrant use of head-shaping when I was an infant.
