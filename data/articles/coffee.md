Japan has a strange relationship with coffee.

The spectrum ranges from exquisite little shops housing nothing more than an espresso machine and a bonsai, both arranged in zen tranquility to filth in cups sold by franchised brands, to tins of coffee vended by the uncountable machines infesting every city, temple and park.

I am going to talk about the cans. The average can is 185g which is an unusual unit of measurement for a liquid. They come from the vending machines cold but can be bought hot from one of the many marts. They are sometimes marketed as a luxury item. This last bit I don't understand.

There are more different cans of coffee than they are ways to take it. White, black, with and without sugar and varying degrees of all of these. Without outside advice you might become paralysed by your choices; a frozen sentinel on the street watching over a vending machine.

It doesn't help that the individual product names are non-sequiturs or are in Japanese. It doesn't help when there are over 125 different cans of coffee.

So make your choice and I'll see you the bottom with my favourite. You may note that some of the cans are just the name of a colour or are differentiated by colour. This the only part of the packaging I understand.

The best I've found is the *Kirin fire great beans* can. It's a small can though and so the *Sapporo pokka Realdrip maroon* is a better investment.
