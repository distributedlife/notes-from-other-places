I love my first arrival to a city even though it brings me mixed feelings. Fresh sights, sounds and smells challenge my preconceptions. What I dislike is getting from the airport to into the city

One thing I dislike is being forced to use taxis at the airport. The journey is often spent explaining why you don't want to go to their hotel, wondering if your being taken the long route or if you've been charged foreigner tax. 

Prospects for exploration itch my feet. Although frequently exhausted I always spend the first day on foot, covering as much of the city as a I can. I don't plan much but rather find my way to the city centre and then I spiral out from there.


My arrival into Lima was and did just that. I brush off every taxi driver before discovering that the bus doesn't run to the airport any more. I trudged back to the taxi touts, exhausted.

Reckless and unrelenting we sped along peculiar road choices through stupendous volumes of traffic. We merged with the seething mass of cars that funnelled into a series of tapering roads until popping like a cork onto a main boulevard. Along this road I caught a glimpse of how Lima could have been. A big bold sign asserted LIMA, trees fringed and green grass filled the islands between the two lanes. The road stretched on and the grass faded and became unkempt. The trees dwindled and disappeared. On the left hand side of the road: the Rio Rimac, beyond that lay a slum of adobe dwellings. The right hand side held richer, luckier inhabitants. The shift in quality distinguishable as these houses are complete.

My driver dropped me off in the Plaza de Almas: the main square. It's eight thirty in the morning. I sit on the steps in front of the Cathedral de Lima and soak in the sounds of the city. The murmer of society, the hum of transport and the gentle honking of sonar-taxis. I have arrived.
