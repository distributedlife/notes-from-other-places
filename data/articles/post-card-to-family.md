I was packing up my house and found a postcard I wrote in Beijing.

*I’m hanging out in the Winter Palace at the moment. The guy on the other side of this postcard [above] isn’t here; but it's still nice. Willows hang over a still grey lake. The smog gives the city on the far side a tranquil charm. The chilled air carries the sound of tape recording of an [Erhu –that stereotypical Chinese string instrument–](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsvzzolvwMo). One could almost forget that behind the veil of pollution are skyscrapers and 17 million people.*

*I hope the world has been kind to you and this postcard reaches you before I do.*

I never posted that card. Hi Mum!
