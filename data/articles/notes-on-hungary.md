Another town where I had twenty four hours, or in this case, 16 hours as I arrived early in the morning and my train departed shortly before midnight. 

### On Budapest

I liked Budapest and I know I didn’t get to scratch the surface. I did use my spade to dig a few holes into one of the roads but that’s it. Budapest is a very pretty city. The danube being overlooked by the feather lady, Castle Buda and and lots of old european buildings. I shot in black and white; it felt appropriate.

If you’re ever in Hungary and need a flat white, let me know as I have the GPS coordinates of a good brew.
