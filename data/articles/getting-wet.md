Malaysia is a place where it’s difficult to remain dry. When it’s not raining, it has recently rained so there are always puddles on the ground. The grass is either damp or deceptively muddy. Showers in most hostels are wet rooms so it’s shower and toilet combined. This means there’s always water on the floor and one doesn’t wear shoes inside houses or hostels. If you do manage to stay dry and avoid all of the above then it’s 32º with humidity around 90%. Your body slowly liquifies as you wade through the gelatinous air.
