I had high hopes. 

They were taken from me.

What more can I say?

I saw more Turkish people drinking Starbucks than I did drinking Turkish coffee. If I wasn’t so uninspired by the lifeless coffee that was served up I would be outraged. 

Ok. 

I still am a little bit. 

Starbucks isn’t great coffee and the Turks put so much effort into their coffee.

First you need to know how much sugar you want in it. This is important because the sugar and coffee grind –and they use a very fine grind– are put into the cezve together. A little water is added. Not much water as a Turkish coffee is served in teeny-tiny cups. These cups are known as demitasse. This coffee mixture is heated until it starts to foam; about halfway through  the process you stir the coffee and sugar together. It’s poured into the demitasse and served. 

The grind is still in the demitasse, so you let that settle and then you take a sip. I’ve been told that Turkish coffee is stronger than regular coffee. That didn’t seem to come through in taste or in caffeine. And it is pleasant tasting. I mean it’s better than Starbucks. It just doesn’t blow your mind.

I wanted my mind blown. Or, at least part of me to say: wow.

One place I went to put mastic into their coffee. I’ve had mastic before, just not in coffee, and it is similar to disinfectant pine. I mean it takes like your licking the disinfectant off your bathroom walls. Turkish coffee with mastic in it is a much better experience. Enjoyable even.
