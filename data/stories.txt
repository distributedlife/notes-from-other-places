 		- Coffee den: Talking about how a thouroughbred is more beautiful athelete than any human. When you have such athletic strength pounding the green field and on top the harlequin outfit of the jockey. Puny in size to the horse. It's more of a spectical than any sport and brings to life a boring paddock. Talks about how Black Caviar in it's 8th race tore it's muscles it's chest and still one. That's the difference between champions; they go above and beyond what is acceptable. I wonder if the horse wanted to go on? Still, he makes a great cup of coffee.
